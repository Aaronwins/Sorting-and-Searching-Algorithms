Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Implementation of Matplotlib to show space time complexity

Objectives for Insertion Sort Code: 
NOTE: It does take some time for runtime as values of n till 50,000. If want a quicker runtime comment the increasing values of n when each function is called

1. Given a random array  of size n sort implement insertion sort.

2. Use the time module in Python or equivalent to time how long it takes to sort an array of n=100, n=10,000, n=100,000, n=1,000,000.Make a plot of runtime vs size n.  How would describe the general shape of the graph? How does it compare to what we discussed in class? (hint: you may need more points to get a better picture of the time complexity)

3. Modify insertion sort to sort the elements in an array in descending order

4. Modify insertion sort to sort alphanumeric values
